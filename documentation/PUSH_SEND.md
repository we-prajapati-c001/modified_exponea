4. Double-clicking the push notification node will open notification builder. There you can specify **Title (1)** and **Message (2)** for your notification. There is a **Preview (4)** on the right side that will show what the notification is going to look like. Use **platform settings (5)** to preview/set platform for test push notification to either Android or iOS. There is also an option to specify an **Image (6)** you want to display and **Sound (9)** that will be played when notification is received.

> When specifying the sound, provide sound name without extension.

## Sending a test push notification
First you'll need to identify your test user with email address. Run the following code in your app:
```dart
import 'package:exponea/exponea.dart';

final _plugin = ExponeaPlugin();
_plugin.identifyCustomer(Customer(ids: {'registered': 'test@test.com'}));
```

Then select the user by email in the notification builder preview, select platform and click **Test push notification** button. The push notification should arrive to your device shortly. 

> Keep in mind on **iOS** push notifications only work on a real device, not on Simulator. On Android, push notifications work on an emulator without issues.
